# VisualStudioCode.ExtensionPack

Aqovia VisualStudioCode ExtensionPack is an extension pack which contains extensions we use for VSCode at Aqovia.

If you wish to add or remove extensions from the pack, you can edit the list within the "extensionPack" section of the package.json file. If you wish to change the major version of the extension pack, this can be done by manually editing the "version" section of the package.json. Minor and patch versions are incremented automatically when built, minor if a "master" branch build, otherwise patch.

Current extensions list -
<!-- EXTENSION_PACK_START -->
